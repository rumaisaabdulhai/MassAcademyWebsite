			<h2>Advanced Computer Science</h2>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> Computer Science is taught by Mrs. Taricco. In Mass Academy, few students who have prior computer science 
					experience embark on an independent computer science project.
					For my independent computer science project, I chose to explore the world of machine learning.  
					I am performing Image Classification where I have evaluated two Machine Learning techniques, namely
					the K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I have worked on it throughout B term
					and will continue working on it during C Term.
				</p>

				<br><br><br><br>
				<h3>Image Classification Project</h3>

				<br><br>

				<p>
					I have been fascinated with how image classification works in the field of computer vision 
					as it has various applications in medicine, security and self driving cars. For example, doctors use image classification in 
					CT scans to identify cancers and tumors. Law enforcement can use image classification to identify suspects. The most interesting
				   application however is in autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars, where pedestrians, objects, or animals must be identified 
				   quickly in time for the car to perform obstacle avoidance. My goal is that if an unclassified image is fed into my program, 
				   it will identify the object by classifying it into one of several categories.
				</p>

				<br><br>

				<p> Below is a presentation I made on the progress of my image classification project. I plan to further fine tune my CNN models by saving the best weights throughout 
					training that minimizes the classification error between training and test sets. I also plan to use a different, larger dataset such as ImageNet and 
					develop an even more accurate model. I want to progress from Keras to TensorFlow as I know I have larger flexibility in programming different types 
					of machine learning models including CNN, RNN, and DNN. You can also view my code <a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/image_classification">here</a>.

				<h3>American Computer Science League</h3>

				<br><br>

				<p> As part of the CS curriculum at Mass Academy, we participate in the American Computer Science League
					 (ACSL) high-school competition. There are two divisions of ACSL that students may participate in:
					 classroom division and senior division. I am participating in the senior division of ACSL. There are multiple contests throughout the year, and we
					 had our first contest in December.
				</p>

				<br><br>

				<p> Below is the take-home problem I completed for ACSL Contest 2 in Python. 
					The problem was to calculate the ACSL Difference Factor given two sentences. 
					The senior division problem is given below if you would like to try it out.

				<h3>Exercise Problems</h3>

				<br><br>

				<p> In the beginning of the year, students on the advanced track had to complete a certain number of challenging
					excercises given by Mrs. Taricco. Here is a problem I coded in Java that finds the largest palindrome formed by two three digit numbers.
					You can also view the code <a class= "link" href= "docs/Palindrome.pdf">here</a>.

				<h3>Mass Academy Website</h3>

				<br><br>

				<p> In A-Term, we learned the basics of HTML and CSS which are two programming languages that are neccessary for designing websites from scratch. 
					If you would like to see the code for this website, follow this <a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/MassAcademyWebsite">link</a>.
