				<h3><a href="#afg">Apps For Good Project</a></h3>
				<h3><a href="#ic">Image Classification Project</a></h3>
			</div>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> 
					Computer Science is taught by Mrs. Taricco. In Mass Academy, few students who have prior computer science 
					experience embark on an independent project. For my project, I chose to explore the world of machine learning.  
					I performed Image Classification where I evaluated two Machine Learning techniques, namely
					the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classifier and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I worked on it throughout B term
					and C Term. In D term, I embarked on an Apps For Good Project with 2 other MAMS students to help high school 
					students find community service opportunities.
				</p>

			</div>

			<h3 id="afg">Apps For Good Project</h3>

			<div class= "regular_text">
				<p> During D Term, my team and I developed an Android Studio Application in Java called HelpOut to help high school students search 
					for volunteer opportunities that interest them. You can find more information on our project below.</p>
			</div>

			<h4>The Problem</h4>

			<div class= "regular_text">
				<p>
					Many students with mandatory community service requirements or students looking to give back to their 
					community struggle to find volunteer opportunities that interest them. There are 16% of potential volunteers who
					do not volunteer due to a lack of nearby volunteer opportunities (Kotecha). Another common reason why people do not 
					volunteer is a lack of interesting volunteer opportunities (Youtopoulus). Therefore, there is a need to 
					provide a platform where potential volunteers can be fully aware of interesting volunteer opportunities nearby and 
					organizations can market their opportunities. Moreover, many nonprofits and other organizations often struggle to pick up 
					interested volunteers. We believe that this arises due to the lack of a common platform between volunteers and organizations. 
					Indeed, the problem is the accessibility of community service opportunities for both people looking to volunteer 
					and organizations that could use potential volunteers.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h4>Target Audience</h4>

			<div class= "regular_text">
				<p>
					HelpOut is targeted towards students who want to volunteer in their communities, but cannot find the right opportunity 
					for them. The app is also aimed at organizations looking for volunteers for events, fundraisers, and as 
					long-term helpers. HelpOut would allow not only for students to find a place to enjoy volunteering, 
					but also allow organizations to gain volunteers that are eager to work in a certain field.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h4>Features of Our App</h4>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> 
					The first main feature of the app is that students may sort 
					opportunities by location and by name. The second is that they can save opportunities to view later by marking 
					it as favorite. First, I used Web Scraping to obtain the title, description, location, contact 
					information, and more for about 135 volunteer opportunities and created a custom database. I stored the 
					database on Firebase, a service by Google for storing data on the cloud. The Android Application reads 
					and displays the data from Firebase. You can view the Java code 
					<a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/HelpOut">here</a>, and the Web Scraping code 
					<a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/WebScraping">here</a>.
					<br><br>
					The video below shows a demo of the application. When the user opens the app for the first time, they
					are brought to a welcome screen that walks them through the app's features. They are then prompted to create 
					an account or sign in. Any opportunities that they favorite or unfavorite will be updated and saved on the cloud and 
					accessible from any device as long as they can sign in.

			<h3 id="ic">Image Classification Project</h3>
			
			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p>
					I have been fascinated with how image classification works in the field of computer vision 
					as it has various applications in medicine, security, and self-driving cars. For example, doctors use image classification in 
					CT scans to identify cancers and tumors. Law enforcement can use image classification to identify suspects. The most interesting 
					application, however, is in autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars, where pedestrians, objects, or animals must be identified 
					quickly in time for the car to perform obstacle avoidance. My goal is that if an unclassified image is fed into my program, 
					it will identify the object by classifying it into one of several categories.
				</p>

				<br><br>

				<p> 
					Below is a presentation I made on the progress of my image classification project. I plan to further fine tune my CNN models by 
					saving the best weights throughout training to minimize the classification error. You can view my code 
					<a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/image_classification">here</a>.
