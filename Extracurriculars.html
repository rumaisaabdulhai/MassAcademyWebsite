			<h3>MIT Lemelson InvenTeams Grant</h3>

			<div class="regular_text">
				<p>
					This summer, I led a project with 3 MAMS students to help high school students search, find, and apply 
					to volunteer opportunities, summer programs, and internships that interest them. Our proposed solution 
					is HelpOut: a mobile application on iOS and Android platforms that would serve as a single destination 
					for high schoolers to effectively search, filter, and directly apply for programs they are passionate 
					about. We developed many the Android mobile application features over the summer, conducted a design 
					study to assess the need for such a platform, wrote a grant proposal, and reached out to high schools and 
					organizations in Massachusetts for support. Our team was selected to be a finalist for the grant. We hope 
					to continue the project during senior year. The <a class= "link" href= "docs/HelpOut.pdf">presentation</a> 
					below gives an overview of the project and also features some demos.

			<h3>Beaver Works Aerial Vehicle Racing</h3>

				<p> 
					As a sophomore, I attended the 2019 Beaver Works summer program at MIT for 4 weeks. I learned how to pilot and program a quadcopter using Python, 
					the Robot Operating System (ROS), and openCV. Every day we would attend seminars from industry leaders including Lincoln Labs 
					and BAE Systems. My experience at Beaver Works inspired me to pursue my <a class= "link" href="STEM_I.html">STEM I</a> Project.

				<p> 
					During the first week, we practiced safety protocol and flying the Intel quadcopter. For the second week, 
					we competed in small challenges such as programming the quadcopter to fly in certain configurations and 
					avoid AR-tagged obstacles. We were even able to trace the shape of Beaver mascot with a light mounted on the 
					quadcopter and a long exposure camera (left).
				</p>	
			</div>
			
			<div class="regular_text">
				<p> For the third week, we learned how to use openCV for computer vision so we could get our drone to follow 
					an LED-illuminated path. Finally, during the fourth week, we prepared for the final racing competition and programmed
					our quadcopter to follow an LED-illuminated path while avoiding AR-tagged obstacles. The left video is a snippet of 
					our drone navigating the obstacle course autonomously. We also made a final 
					<a class= "link" href="docs/Nomad_Presentation.pdf">presentation</a> that gives an overview of our code.

			<h3>International Math Modeling</h3>

			<div class="regular_text">
					<p> 
						At MAMS, I became passionate about Math Modeling. I developed a keen interest for solving these modeling problems 
						as they tackled issues in the real world– from climate change and energy consumption to marketing and sales. In 
						November 2019, I formed a team with 3 MAMS students to compete in the 2019 High School Math Contest in Modeling 
						(HiMCM), where a total of 791 teams competed. You can read more about my HiMCM experience here. We were proud of 
						our work and had a lot of fun while doing it. We were thrilled when our team US-9539 won the Finalist Prize. 
						We wanted to see what other competitions were out there, and found we were qualified to compete in the 2020 
						International Mathematical Modeling Competition (IMMC).
						See the 2020 problem <a class= "link" href= "docs/IMMC_Problem.pdf">here</a>.

					Below is a demo of the simulation I developed in Python that models the products damaged for various store 
					layouts. You can find the code <a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/IMMC_2020">here</a>. 
					We modeled population density, product density, obstruction of view from cashiers, and number of customers to 
					develop a scoring system to predict the total number of damaged products in a flash sale. Although we were 
					unable to work together in person, we are grateful we had the opportunity to collaborate virtually.

						I also competed in the 14-hour MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge with 4 MAMS students this February. We created a model to determine 
						the number and locations of charging stations along major U.S. trucking routes for an all-electric trucking industry, and had to 
						prioritize which routes should be developed with electric charging infrastructure first.

				<p> 
					During my 9th and 10th grades, I was a programmer on my school's FIRST robotics team. FIRST 
					is an organization which runs robotics competitions for children from elementary school to high school.
					In 2018, our team 467 qualified for the FRC World Championships in Detroit. This is a picture
