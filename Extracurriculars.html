			<h3>MIT Lemelson InvenTeams Grant</h3>

			<div class="regular_text">
				<p> 
					This past summer (2020), I embarked on an project with 3 other MAMS students to help high school students search, find, and apply 
					to volunteer opportunities, summer programs, and internships that interest them. We developed a lot of the Android mobile application 
					features over the summer, wrote a grant proposal, and reached out to high schools and organizations in MA for support. Our team 
					was selected to be a finalist for the grant. We hope to continue the project during senior year. Click <a class= "link" href= "docs/backgroundResearch.pdf">here</a> to 
					find the background research summary we submitted for our application HelpOut to the Lemelson InvenTeams committee.

			<h3>Math Modeling</h3>

			<div class="regular_text">
					<p> 
						At MAMS, I developed a passion for Math Modeling. In November, I formed a team with 3 Mass Academy students 
						to compete in the 2019 High School Math Contest in Modeling (HiMCM), where a total of 791 teams participated. 
						We were really happy with our performance and had a lot of fun while doing it. We were even more excited 
						when our team US-9539 won the Finalist Prize for HiMCM. We wanted to see what other competitions were out there, 
						and found we were qualified to participate in the 2020 International Mathematical Modeling Competition (IMMC).
						See the 2020 problem <a class= "link" href= "docs/IMMC_Problem.pdf">here</a>.

					Below is the simulation I developed in Python for IMMC. See the code 
					<a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/IMMC_2020">here</a>. We modeled population 
					density, product density, obstruction of view from cashiers, and total customers to develop a scoring 
					system to predict the total number of damaged products in a flash sale. Although we were unable to work 
					together in person, we are grateful we had the opportunity to collaborate virtually. See our paper 
					<a class= "link" href= "docs/IMMC_Paper.pdf">here</a>.

						I also competed in the 14-hour MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge with 4 other MAMS students in February. We created a model to determine 
						the number and locations of charging stations along major U.S. trucking routes for an all-electric trucking industry, and to 
						prioritize which routes should be developed with electric charging infrastructure first. To see our paper we submitted, click <a class= "link" href= "docs/MathWorks_Paper.pdf">here</a>.

				<p> 
					As a sophomore, I attended the 2019 BWSI Summer Program for 4 weeks. I learned how to pilot and program a quadcopter. 
					I also gained skills in the Robot Operating System (ROS), linear algebra, openCV, 
					and git version control. Every day we would attend seminars from industry leaders including 
					Lincoln Labs and BAE Systems. My experience at BWSI inspired me to pursue my <a class= "link" href="STEM_I.html">STEM I</a> Project.

				<p> 
					During the first week, we practiced safety protocol and flying the Intel Research Quadcopter. For the second week, 
					we competed in small challenges such as programming the quadcopter to fly in certain configuration and avoid AR-tagged obstacles. 
					To the left is the Beaver mascot we were able to trace with a light mounted on the quadcopter and a long exposure camera.

			<div class="regular_text">
				<p> For the third week, we completed labs on using openCV for computer vision so we could get our drone to follow 
					an LED-illuminated path. Finally, during the fourth week, we prepared for the final racing competition and programmed
					our quadcopter to follow an LED-illuminated path while avoiding AR-tagged obstacles. The left video is a snippet of 
					our drone navigating the obstacle course autonomously. To see the code explained, view this <a class= "link" href="docs/Nomad_Presentation.pdf">presentation</a>.

				<p> 
					During my 9th and 10th grades, I was a programmer on my school's FIRST robotics team. FIRST 
					is an organization which runs robotics competitions for children from elementary school to high school.
					In 2018, our team 467 qualified for the FRC World Championships in Detroit. This is a picture
					of me with my team there.
