			<h3>Math Modeling</h3>

			<div class="regular_text">
					<p> 
						In MAMS, I developed a passion for Math Modeling. In November, I formed a team with 3 Mass Academy students 
						to compete in the 2019 High School Math Contest in Modeling (HiMCM), where a total of 791 teams participated. 
						We were really happy with our performance and had a lot of fun while doing it. We were even more excited 
						when our team US-9539 won the Finalist Prize for HiMCM. We wanted to see what other competitions were out there, 
						and found we were qualified to participate in the 2020 International Mathematical Modeling Competition (IMMC).
						See the 2020 problem <a class= "link" href= "docs/IMMC_Problem.pdf">here</a>.

						To the right is the simulation I developed in Python for IMMC. See the code 
						<a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/IMMC_2020">here</a>. We modeled population 
						density, product density, obstruction of view from cashiers, and total customers to develop a scoring 
						system to predict the total number of damaged products in a flash sale. Although we were unable to work 
						together in person, we are grateful we had the opportunity to collaborate virtually and it was truly a 
						memorable experience. See our paper <a class= "link" href= "docs/IMMC_Paper.pdf">here</a>.

						I also competed in the 14-hour MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge with 4 other MAMS students in February. We created a model to determine 
						the number and locations of charging stations along major U.S. trucking routes for an all-electric trucking industry, and to 
						prioritize which routes should be developed with electric charging infrastructure first. To see our paper we submitted, click <a class= "link" href= "docs/MathWorks_Paper.pdf">here</a>.

			<h3>Beaver Works</h3>

			<div class="regular_text">
				<p> 
					As a sophomore, I attended the 2019 Beaver Works Summer Program for 4 weeks. I learned so much throughout my time there, 
					including how to pilot and program a quadcopter. I gained skills in the Robot Operating System (ROS), linear algebra, openCV, 
					and version control using git. Every day we would attend seminars from industry leaders including 
					Lincoln Labs and BAE Systems. My experience at Beaver Works inspired me to pursue my <a class= "link" href="STEM_I.html">STEM I</a> Project.

							During the first week, we practiced safety protocol and flying the Intel Research Quadcopter. For the second week, 
							we competed in small challenges such as programming the quadcopter to fly in certain configuration and avoid AR-tagged obstacles. 
							To the left is the Beaver mascot we were able to trace with a light mounted on the quadcopter and a long exposure camera.

						<p> For the third week, we completed labs on using openCV for computer vision so we could get our drone to follow 
							an LED-illuminated path. Finally, during the fourth week, we prepared for the final racing competition and programmed
							our quadcopter to follow an LED-illuminated path while avoiding AR-tagged obstacles. The left video is a snippet of 
							our drone navigating the obstacle course autonomously. To see the code explained, view this <a class= "link" href="docs/Nomad_Presentation.pdf">presentation</a>.

			<h3>Robotics</h3>

					<p> 
						During my 9th and 10th grades, I was a programmer on my school's FIRST robotics team. FIRST 
						is an organization which runs robotics competitions for children from elementary school to high school.
						In 2018, our team 467 qualified for the FRC World Championships in Detroit. This is a picture
						of me with my team there.
