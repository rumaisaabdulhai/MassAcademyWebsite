				<p> Drawing has always been near and dear to my heart. It has become a way for me to de-stress 
					when I have a lot of work. I like to draw people, animals, and flowers. Most of the time, I stick 
					to an animated style of drawing, but I do enjoy a bit of realism. Someday, I hope to create a manga of my own. 
					To the left is a drawing of me and my lovebird Petite. Click 
					<a class= "link" href="https://youtu.be/udfM3Xeph-I">here</a> to see a traditional speedpaint of me 
					drawing my lovebirds.

				<img class= "right_image" src= "Images/bird.jpeg" alt="My Cute Lovebird">
					<p> With my mom, I take care of twelve lovebirds, 
						making them special food and playing with them. 
						I raised six of them since they hatched out of 
						their eggs, watching them grow from feeble, 
						red-skinned babies to fluffy, noisy birds. Simply 
						holding them on my finger and letting them fly in my 
						house relieves me of all the accumulated stress from school.

				<img class= "left_image" src= "Images/Cupcake.jpg" alt="cupcake">
				<p> I love making food for my friends and family. Usually, I bake cheesecakes and cupcakes 
					for my sisters' and parents' birthdays. I also make lobster bisque with my dad. 
					I've recently been making passion fruit boba and Indian chaats with my sister as a late night snack.

				<p> My interest in robotics started in 6th grade when I visited the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey. 
					After building a rubiks cube solver using Lego Mindstorms, I wanted to see what else I could do with 
					existing parts I had at home and a 3D pen. In 8th grade, I built a 3D printer using Lego parts and a 
					microcontroller. I learned a lot about how a 3D printer prints layer by layer.
