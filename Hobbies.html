					<p> With my mom, I take care of twelve lovebirds, 
						making them special food and playing with them. 
						I raised six of them since they hatched out of 
						their eggs, watching them grow from feeble, 
						red-skinned babies to fluffy, noisy birds. Simply 
						holding them on my finger and letting them fly in my 
						house relieves me of all the accumulated stress from school.

					<p> I love making food for my friends and family. 
						Usually, I bake cheesecakes and cupcakes for my sisters' and parents' birthdays.
						I also make lobster bisque with my dad. 
						I've recently been obssessed with chia seed pudding ever since 
						one of my friends recommended it to me.

						<p> Drawing has always been near 
							and dear to my heart. It has become a way for me to de-stress when I have a lot of work. I like to draw people, 
							animals, and flowers. I stick to an animated style of drawing most of the time, but I do enjoy a bit of 
							realism. I also doodle a lot on my school notebooks and sheets, so if you find that little eye in the corner 
							it's my signature.

						<p> In 8th grade, I built a 3D printer using Lego parts and a microcontroller. I had previously built
							a rubiks cube solver in 6th grade wanted to see what else I could do with existing parts I had at home and a 3D pen.
							I learned a lot about how a 3D printer prints layer by layer. This was how my interest in robotics began. It was also at this time that
							my science teacher recommended me to join the robotics team for high school.
