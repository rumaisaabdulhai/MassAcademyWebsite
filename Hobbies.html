					<p> With my mom, I take care of twelve lovebirds, 
						making them special food and playing with them. 
						I raised six of them since they hatched out of 
						their eggs, watching them grow from feeble, 
						red-skinned babies to fluffy, noisy birds. Simply 
						holding them on my finger and letting them fly in my 
						house relieves me of all the accumulated stress from school.

					<p> I love making food for my friends and family. 
						Usually, I bake cheesecakes and cupcakes for my sisters' and parents' birthdays.
						I also make lobster bisque with my dad. 
						I've recently been obssessed with chia seed pudding ever since 
						one of my friends recommended it to me.

					<p> During my 9th and 10th grades, I was a programmer on my school's FIRST robotics team. FIRST 
						is an organization which runs robotics competitions for children from elementary school to high school.
						During my 9th grade, our team 467 qualified for the FRC World Championships in Detroit. This is a picture
						of me with my team there. I look forward to competing as a member of the Mass Academy's Team 190 this year.

						<p> Drawing has always been near 
							and dear to my heart. When I was small, I used to draw for fun (and I still do),
							but now drawing has become a way for me to de-stress when I have a lot of work. I like to draw people, 
							animals, and flowers. I stick to an animated style of drawing most of the time, but I do enjoy a bit of 
							realism. I also doodle a lot on my school notebooks and sheets, so if you find that little eye in the corner 
							it's my signature.</a>

						<p> In 8th grade, I built a 3D printer using Lego parts and a microcontroller. I had previously built
							a rubiks cube solver in 6th grade wanted to see what else I could do with existing parts I had at home and a 3D pen.
							I learned a lot about how a 3D printer prints layer by layer. It was also at this time that
							my science teacher recommended me to join the robotics team for high school. 
							On Team 467, I learned so much about robotics and
							the importance of team work and collaboration.
