						Humanities is taught by Mrs. Small. At the beginning of junior year, we wrote skits relating to the themes presented
						in Walden. We've read interesting pieces in class, from poetry written by Ancient Egyptian people to the work of a 
						modern psychologist studying stereotypes. We have writing assignments, but we also work on group projects 
						and present to the class.

						Below is a satirical analysis I wrote during B term. My analysis compares a satire and an 
						informational article about Animal Testing and argues why the satirical piece is more effective. 
						You can also view it <a class= "link" href= "docs/AnimalTest.pdf">here</a>.

			<div class = "regular_text">
					<p> 
						Below is a literary analysis I wrote during C term. My analysis discusses how the Women of Troy resonates with authors 
						and individuals of many cultures due its timeless description of the horrific trauma women had to endure in the aftermath of war. 
						You can also view it <a class= "link" href= "docs/Conflict_Essay.pdf">here</a>.
