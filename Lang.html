			<h2>Advanced Immersion Spanish</h2>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> 
					Language is taught by Sra. Wildfong. At Mass Academy, students have the choice of taking either French or Spanish. 
					For each language, there are advanced and intermediate counterparts. I am taking advanced Immersion Spanish as I have 
					taken Spanish at my sending school. In class, we read interesting stories, learn about Spanish culture by listening to music
					or watching movies, and also learn a bit of grammar.

			<h3>Laberinto del Fauno</h3>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> 
					During C Term, we watched Laberinto del Fauno by Guillermo del Toro in class. The story takes place after the Spanish Civil War, and 
					it is about a young girl named Ofelia and her pregnant mother who stay with Ofelia's stepfather, Captain Vidal. Ofelia follows a fairy 
					into a secret Labrynth and meets a faun who believes she is the lost Princess Moanna from the Underworld. The faun promises to return 
					Ofelia to the Underworld only if she successfully completes 3 tasks. We had to write from the perspective of one of the characters in 
					the story. I wrote from the perspective of the Doctor Ferreiro who works for the Captain but is secretly a rebel. You can also view 
					the reflection <a class= "link" href= "docs/Laberinto_del_Fauno.pdf">here</a>.

			<h3>Arroz con Leche</h3>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> 
					During D Term, we all had to make a Spanish dish for our family. I chose to make rice pudding because my mom makes it at home. I had a lot 
					of fun making the dish. You can also view the presentation
