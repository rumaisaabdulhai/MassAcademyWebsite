			<h2>Advanced Immersion Spanish</h2>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> Language is taught by Sra. Wildfong. At Mass Academy, students have the choice of taking either French or Spanish. For each language, there are
					advanced and intermediate counterparts. I am taking advanced Immersion Spanish as I have taken taken Spanish at
					my sending school. In class, we read interesting stories, learn about Spanish culture by listening to music
					or watching movies, and also learn a bit of grammar.

				<h3>Learning a Second Language</h3>

				<p> Below is a reflection I completed in the beginning of year on why learning a second language is beneficial. I enjoyed reading <a class= "link" href= "docs/TamimAnsary.pdf">Tamim Ansary's</a>
					perspective on this topic. You can also view the reflection <a class= "link" href= "docs/SecondLanguage.pdf">here</a>.

				<h3>Childhood Story</h3>

				<p> After learning the preterite versus imperfect tense in Spanish, we wrote a story about an event that happened during our childhood. Below
					is my childhood story (about how my sister's DS broke) written in the preterite and imperfect tenses. 
					You can also view the story <a class= "link" href= "docs/Cuento.pdf">here</a>.

				<h3>Spanish Meme</h3>

				<p> In B term, we made memes in spanish relating to our experiences at Mass Academy so far. Below is a meme I made with a classmate about the
					Mathematica Labs we had to complete for Mr. Regele during B term. At first, Mathematica was a little challenging to learn,
					but after completing modeling problems with it, I see how I could use the application in the future. I used Matlab to make the
					meme as I was learning about computer vision for my Indpendent CS <a class= "link" href= "CS.html">Project</a>.
