					Math Modeling is taught by Mr. Regele. In class, we solve realistic problems working 
					as teams and present our ideas to the class. We also solve problem sets every week that build upon 
					what we've learned in the previous terms.

			<h3>High School Math Contest in Modeling</h3>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> 
					We also participated in HiMCM, a 36 hour math modeling competition for high school students. We were given two problems
					and had to choose between one of them. The problem our team chose was about the energy consumption of electric cars, 
					smartphones, and laptops over the years and the increase of charging stations as we found it was very relevant to today. 
					Follow this <a class= "link" href= "docs/HiMCMDescriptions.pdf">link</a> to view the problem descriptions.
					My group used Python for the competition and made classes for each function we required. We were pleasantly 
					surprised to find we won the Finalist Prize for HiMCM out of 791 teams! If you would like to view our code, follow this 
					<a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/HiMCMteam9539/Charging">link</a>.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<p> The competiton required us to submit a 20-page paper with short summary of our solution to the problem. 
					Below is our paper. You can also view 
					it <a class= "link" href= "docs/HiMCMPaper.pdf">here</a>.
