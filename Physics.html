				<p> Physics is taught by Mr. Ellis. We learned principles from kinematics, energy, and rotational motion all the way to electricity and magnetism.
					For every unit, we work on a long Uber Problem, which involves many careful steps. Students have a choice of doing the calculus 
					or algebra uber problem. There are two tracks in Physics: the Algebra track and the Calculus track. I was in the Calculus track. 
					The tracks differ in that during tests, students on the calculus track must solve the calculus problem.

			<h3>2D Electric Potential Lab</h3>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> Towards the end of C Term, we learned about how charges create electric potential and how they 
					exert forces on each other, similar to how two masses exert gravitational forces on each other. For our 
					2D Electric Potential <a class= "link" href= "docs/Elec_Potential.pdf">Lab</a>, we were given four 
					charges, and had to plot the magnitude of the net electric potential relative to a neutral charge. 
					We made a variety of plots, such as a contour plot and a Surface plot of the net electric 
					potentials, as you can see below.
