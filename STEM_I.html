			<h3>An Autonomous Drone Application To Assist Police During Mass Shootings</h3>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> 
					Mass shootings have claimed thousands of lives in the US as there are no effective mechanisms to prevent them. 
					One can never tell when and where the next shooting will happen, inciting fear among students, teachers, and 
					worshippers in churches, synagogues, and mosques. After the 2018 Parkland shooting, I thought about how I could 
					use technology to protect my classmates if a shooting were to happen at my school. In the summer of 2019, I 
					attended the Beaver Works Summer Program, where I learned how to program an intel drone in Python to navigate a 
					path with obstacles autonomously. As I programmed the drone to identify visual markers and fly up or dive down 
					to avoid obstacles, I wondered: could drones be used to protect lives during school shootings?

					<br><br>

					Hence for my year-long STEM project, I developed an autonomous drone application to 
					assist police during school shootings. I used ROS, Gazebo, and Python to enable a quadcopter to navigate to 
					a precise location inside a school where the perpetrator and victims of a mass shooting are likely to be found. 
					I learned how to create an occupancy grid map of a complex school using the GMapping SLAM algorithm, a quadcopter, 
					and a 2D LiDAR. I built a navigation component with Dijkstraâ€™s and Dynamic-Window path-planning algorithms to 
					enable the drone to navigate to any location inside the school. I also added a streaming component to transmit 
					live video from the drone to a web server that police could monitor. My application demonstrated that indoor 
					drones with intelligent software could inform police of real-time dangers during school shootings, enabling 
					them to take timely actions to save human lives.

				<p>
					In April, I had the opportunity to represent Mass Academy with 8 other students at the Massachusetts State Science Fair 
					(MSEF) held virtually. Below is the poster I presented at MSEF. You can also find it 
					<a class= "link" href= "docs/STEM_I_Poster.pdf">here</a>. My project won 3rd place at the fair. 
					I also presented my STEM I project at the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools (NCSSS) Conference held in June.

				<p>
					As part of our STEM I Project, we had to write a thesis. In the

			<h3>RRT Path Planning Implementation</h3>

			<div class="wrap">
				<img class= "right_image" src= "Images/RRT.png"  alt= "RRT Picture">
				<p> Path planning algorithms are necessary to determine 
					an optimal path from a chosen source point to a destination point and are used extensively in the fields of robotics. 
					The Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) Algorithm caught my eye as it can determine 
					a possible path in a very short amount of time. I used path planning after I mapped the indoor environment 
					so my drone could navigate from one location to another. I coded the RRT Algorithm in a simple 2D Python Simulator called Pygame. You can find my code <a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/PathPlanning/blob/master/rrt_modified.py">here</a>.
