				<h2>Simulation of an Indoor Autonomous Drone for Assisting Police in Mass Shootings</h2>

				<br><br><br><br>
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p> 
					The STEM I and II Courses are taught by Dr. Crowthers at Mass Academy. In STEM I, Mass Academy juniors are required to conduct a 
					5-month long science or engineering project. In A Term, we brainstormed ideas for our STEM Project. In B Term, we conducted a Literature Review 
					on relevant journal articles in our field. During December Fair, we presented our research and preliminary results on our project
					to advisors and Mass Academy seniors. We also have a February Fair where we present our STEM Project to the public. I am working
					on an engineering project using autonomous drones to assist law enforcement during mass shootings and save precious lives.
				</p>

				<h3>Abstract</h3>

				<p> 
					Mass school shootings have claimed hundreds of lives in the United States as there are no effective mechanisms to prevent them. 
					This project investigates the use of autonomous indoor aerial vehicles to assist law enforcement during mass school shootings. 
					The Robot Operating System (ROS), the Gazebo platform, and Python were used to develop an autonomous indoor drone application 
					that allows a drone to navigate from a start position to a destination inside a school where the perpetrator and potential 
					victims are likely to be found. First, a 2D probabilistic occupancy grid-map of a US middle school’s indoor environment was 
					achieved using a quadcopter, 2D Lidar, and grid-mapping algorithm. Next, Adaptive Monte-Carlo Localization (AMCL) was used with 
					Dijkstra’s global path planning and Dynamic-Window Approach (DWA) local planning algorithms to enable the drone to navigate from 
					the starting position towards the goal position while avoiding obstacles. The mapping process took approximately 7 hours for a 
					middle school with the main office, media center, auditorium, cafeteria, courtyard, 4 hallways, and 12 classrooms. The drone 
					navigated autonomously from the courtyard to a classroom 43.37 m away in 171 seconds at an average speed of 0.254 m/s. Finally, 
					an onboard camera on the UAV successfully captured and transmitted video from the scene in real-time to a web server. This 
					application serves as proof of the concept that indoor drones could be used to inform law enforcement of potential dangers 
					during school shootings, enabling them to take appropriate actions to save precious lives.

					<h4>Engineering Goal</h4>
					<p> The goal of this project is to engineer algorithms for simulating the navigation of an indoor autonomous drone
						 to the precise location of a mass shooting, the collection of real-time information about its perpetrators and
						  potential victims, and its transmission to law enforcement to enable them to take appropriate action to save human lives.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="left_text">
					<h4>Engineering Problem</h4>
					<p> There is an immediate need for law enforcement personnel to know real-time information about the precise location, 
						perpetrator(s), and potential victims of a mass shooting in order to significantly reduce the loss of life.

			<h3>RRT Path Planning Implementation</h3>

			<div class="wrap">

				<div class="left_text">
					<p> Path planning algorithms are necessary to determine 
						an optimal path from a chosen source point to a destination point and are used extensively in the fields of robotics. 
						The Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) Algorithm caught my eye as it can determine 
						a possible path in a very short amount of time. I used path planning after I mapped the indoor environment 
						so my drone could navigate from one location to another. I coded the RRT Algorithm in a simple 2D Python Simulator called Pygame. You can find my code <a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/PathPlanning/blob/master/rrt_modified.py">here</a>.
