				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p> The STEM I and II Courses are taught by Dr. Crowthers at Mass Academy. In STEM I, Mass Academy juniors are required to conduct a 
					5-month long science or engineering project. In A Term, we brainstormed ideas for our STEM Project. In B Term, we conducted a Literature Review 
					on relevant journal articles in our field. During December Fair, we presented our research and preliminary results on our project
					to advisors and Mass Academy seniors. We also have a February Fair where we present our STEM Project to the public. I am working
					on an engineering project using autonomous drones to assist law enforcement during mass shootings and save precious lives.

				<h3>Abstract</h3>

				<p> Mass shootings in schools and places of worship have claimed hundreds of lives in the United States during the last several years as there are no effective mechanisms
					 to prevent them. This project investigates the use of autonomous indoor aerial vehicles to assist police in critical emergency tasks during school shootings. 
					 The Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo software platform were used to successfully simulate the navigation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from a start 
					 position to a goal position where the perpetrator and potential victims of a school shooting are likely to be found. First, a 2D occupancy map of a typical US 
					 middle school’s indoor environment was achieved using a quadcopter, a 2D laser sensor, and the grid-mapping algorithm. Next, Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization 
					 (AMCL) was used with Dijikstra’s global path planning and the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) local planning algorithms to successfully navigate from a source 
					 point to a destination while avoiding obstacles. The mapping process took approximately 7 hours to map a middle school with a main office, media center, 
					 auditorium, cafeteria, courtyard, 4 hallways, and 12 classrooms. Finally, an onboard camera on the UAV was used to successfully capture and transmit 
					 video from the scene in real time to a web server. This project serves as proof of concept that unmanned aerial vehicles or autonomous drones could 
					 be used to inform law enforcement of the potential dangers during mass school shootings thereby enabling them to take immediate and appropriate actions to save human lives.

					<h4>Engineering Goal</h4>
					<p> The goal of this project is to engineer algorithms for simulating the navigation of an indoor autonomous drone
						 to the precise location of a mass shooting, the collection of real-time information about its perpetrators and
						  potential victims, and its transmission to law enforcement to enable them to take appropriate action to save human lives.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="left_text">
					<h4>Engineering Problem</h4>
					<p> There is an immediate need for law enforcement personnel to know real-time information about the precise location, 
						perpetrator(s), and potential victims of a mass shooting in order to significantly reduce the loss of life.

					<p> To the left is my application design for this project. I chose to have 5 packages for the different
						parts of my indoor drone application. I developed the code for my project using the programming language

			<h3>RRT Path Planning Implementation</h3>

			<div class="wrap">
				<img class= "right_image" src= "Images/RRT.png"  alt= "RRT Picture">
				<div class="left_text">
					<p> Path planning algorithms are necessary to determine 
						an optimal path from a chosen source point to a destination point and are used extensively in the fields of robotics. 
						The Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) Algorithm caught my eye as it can determine 
						a possible path in a very short amount of time. I used path planning after I mapped the indoor environment 
						so my drone could navigate from one location to another. I coded the RRT Algorithm in a simple 2D Python Simulator called Pygame. You can find my code <a class= "link" href= "https://github.com/rumaisaabdulhai/PathPlanning/blob/master/rrt_modified.py">here</a>.
