				<p> The STEM II class is taught by Dr. Crowthers. In STEM II, Mass Academy juniors embark on 
					4-month long group assistive technology projects for clients at Seven Hills. Although this 
					year we had to do most of STEM II remotely, it was a memorable experience and thanks to 
					Dr. C we were able to make physical prototypes of our proposed solutions. Throughout this 
					project, we learned how to CAD, 3D print our models, and cater to our clients' needs.

			<h3>Drum Frame Mount</h3>

			<div class = "regular_text">

				<p> Our team worked on building a drum frame mount for individuals with limited hand mobility. 
					We sought guidance from Ms. Ritter at Seven Hills, the director of the music department for 
					our clients. You can find more information on our project below. We made an 
					<a class= "link" href= "https://www.instructables.com/Engineering-a-Drum-Frame-Mount/">instructables</a> 
					for our design as well.

			<h3>Problem</h3>

			<div class = "regular_text">

				<p> Music is an essential part of many peoples’ lives and is often an indispensable part of their work, 
				   education, or therapy. Music provides significant health benefits such as lessening anxiety and stress,
					boosting confidence, and even improving cognitive recognition (Pfizer Medical Team, 2017). Moreover, 
					playing music is known to provide useful therapy, often being used to treat conditions such as cerebral 
					palsy, Parkinson’s disease, and other cognitive diseases (Alfredo et al. 2015). Music therapy is often 
					used to treat patients with limited hand mobility (Alfredo et al, 2015). However, many instruments are 
					not geared for individuals with limited hand mobility. For instance, Individuals with loose handgrip or 
					limited mobility may find it difficult to grasp onto a drum and play it at the same time. In order to 
					ensure that musicians with limited hand mobility can play the drums comfortably, it is imperative to 
					develop assistive technology that can position a drum in front of the user and attach it to a table or 
					wheelchair. Therefore, the goal of this project is to design a drum frame mount that attaches to both 
					tables and wheelchairs to enable individuals with limited hand mobility or loose handgrip to comfortably 
					play the drum.

			<h3>Approach</h3>

			<div class = "regular_text">
				<p> We began by conducting research on the health benefits of playing music for people with limited hand mobility and 
					the main competitors for an accessible drum frame. Based on the needs of the client and the pros and cons of the 
					competitors, we came up with 3 initial design concepts: a telescoping adjustable drum holder, two-way G-clamps, and 
					a miniature table. After talking with the client and evaluating our designs, we decided to investigate the two-way 
					G-clamp design. One side would clamp on to the table or wheeelchair while the other clamp would hold the drum. We 
					up with 3 prototypes: a simple two-way clamp with no pivot, a two-way clamp with a metal hose neck, and a two-way 
					clamp with a slotted ball hinge connector. We were able to 3D print these designs and perform studies to test their 
					strength and resilience under tension. Through design studies, we found that the metal hose neck was not stable enough 
					and that we needed to make changes to our clamp screw. Our final design utilized the simple two-way G clamp with no pivot. 
					You can find images of our prototype designs and final prototype below.
