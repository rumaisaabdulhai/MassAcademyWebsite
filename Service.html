					Since 2019, I have volunteered for 
					<a class= "link" href= "https://new.hhrd.org/">Helping Hand for Relief & Development</a> (HHRD). 
					HHRD is a humanitarian relief organization supports underpriveleged and refugee families in over 85 countries 
					including Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan, and Pakistan. During winter, I packed donated clothes, food, 
					and toys in HHRD warehouses that are shipped to Jordan and Pakistan. In April 2020, I organized an online fundraiser 
					and spoke at the event, raising $38,000 to build 20 water and sanitation facilities for Syrian refugees in Jordan. 
					During the months of Ramadan and Qurbani, I called donors, requesting them to donate for food packages, sponsor 
					orphan children, or provide for their educational assistance. This summer, I began an online mentorship initiative 
					to teach Java and Python to refugee students in Jordan and Pakistan. As an Indian American, volunteering helps me 
					give back to those in harsh situations similar to my immigrant parents growing up in India.

					Volunteering my time to improve the condition of underprivileged women in my community gives me a sense of 
					commitment, humility, and satisfaction. I have been a volunteer for Indian Muslim Relief and Charities since 
					2015, an organization that helps women and children in India afflicted by poverty, natural disasters, and 
					communal riots. My duties include making phone calls to donors, distributing flyers, and cleaning up after 
					fundraising events. I have helped organize annual fundraisers in New Jersey since 2017, raising money to 
					build 50 tube-wells in Kashmir that provide clean water to about 25,000 people and support education to 
					150 orphan children in Hyderabad.

				<p>
					Last summer in 2019, I volunteered at my local mosque, the Worcester Islamic Center, and taught 
					students from grades 4-8 about building and programming robots with Lego Mindstorms. My tasks included 
					helping the students connect the different parts such as actuators and sensors, and guiding students with 
					their programs using block coding. During my time, I worked closely with two female students in the 3rd and 
					4th grade. Seeing their excited and proud faces when they finally got their robot to follow 
					a black line was really inspiring for me. Even though it was a bit difficult trying to teach them when they 
					had limited knowledge of concepts such as speed, I had a lot of fun and hoped they learned a lot too.
