				<h2>About Me</h2>

					<div class="wrap_text">
						<div class="text">
							<p> 
								Hi there! My name is Rumaisa Abdulhai and I am a senior at the Massachusetts Academy of Math 
								& Science at WPI (MAMS). This year I will be attending classes at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). 
								I attended Shrewsbury High School for my 9th and 10th grades.

						<div class="right_text">
							<p> 
								I am the youngest of three siblings. My eldest sister attends medical school, and my other sister just 
								graduated from college. In my free time, I love to draw and spend time with my family. I've lived in 3 
								different countries, and have attended 6 different schools before MAMS. The picture on the left 
								is me (center) with my two sisters.

						<div class="left_text">
							<p> 
								I have twelve beautiful lovebirds. We started with only two from a nice bird owner, 
								and since then they've grown to a little flock! My birds love to eat apple
								and millet. They also love to chirp all day long, especially when they're sleepy. 
								We do let our birds fly around the house so they can have fun. The picture on the 
								right is my sister holding one of the birds when he was a baby.

							<p> 
								This April, I competed in the 5-day International Mathematical Contest in Modeling (IMMC) with 3 MAMS students. 
								We developed simulations in Python and Java to maximize revenue in flash sales like Black Friday while minimizing damage 
								to products. We were pleasantly surprised that we won the Finalist Prise for IMMC in the US!

						<div class="left_text">
							<p>
								In 2019, I attended a 4-week summer program called Beaver Works at MIT. I worked on the autonomous drone racing course.
								We had to program a research drone to autonomously navigate an illuminated trajectory while avoiding AR tagged obstacles.
								There were people from all over the United States. Here I am holding the drone we competed with. 
								I can't believe we won 1st place at the end of our program! Click <a class= "link" href="Extracurriculars.html">here</a> to read more about my experience.

							<p> 
								My family is originally from a town in South India called Kengeri. The picture to the right is me with my 
								parents when we visited India in 2018 for my cousin's wedding. Wedding festivities in India usually last
								a week or two, which I love because of all the great food I get to eat.
