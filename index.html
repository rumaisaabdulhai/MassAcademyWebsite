				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<div class="regular_text">
						<p> 
							Hello! I'm Rumaisa Abdulhai, a senior at the Massachusetts Academy of Math 
							& Science at WPI (MAMS). This year, I am attending classes at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). 
							I attended Shrewsbury High School for my 9th and 10th grades. Feel free to look through my website to learn more 
							about my interests, hobbies, and extracurriculars!

					<p> 
						I am the youngest of three siblings. My eldest sister attends medical school (center), and my other sister just 
						graduated from college (right). In my free time, I love to draw and spend time with my family. I am grateful to 
						have lived in 3 different countries, and have attended 6 different schools before MAMS. The picture on the left 
						is me (left) with my two sisters.

						<p> 
							I have twelve beautiful lovebirds. We started with only two from a nice bird owner, 
							and since then they've grown to a little flock! My birds love to eat apple
							and millet. They also love to chirp all day long, especially when they're sleepy. 
							The picture on the right is my sister holding one of the birds when he was a baby.

					<img class= "left_image" src= "Images/IMMC_Gang.jpeg"  alt= "A Zoom Picture of Me with My Team">
						<p> 
							In April of 2020, I competed in the 5-day International Mathematical Contest in Modeling (IMMC) with 3 MAMS students.
							We developed simulations in Python and Java to maximize revenue in flash sales (like Black Friday) while minimizing damage 
							to products. We were pleasantly surprised that we won the Finalist Prise for IMMC in the US!

					<img class= "right_image" src= "Images/beaverworks.JPG"  alt= "Me with My Team For the BWSI Summer Program">
						<p>
							In 2019, I attended a 4-week summer program called Beaver Works at MIT. I was part of the autonomous drone racing course.
							We had to program a research drone to autonomously navigate an illuminated trajectory while avoiding AR tagged obstacles.
							There were students from all over the United States. The picture to the right is our team, and I am holding the drone we 
							competed with. I can't believe we won 1st place at the end of our program! Click <a class= "link" href="Extracurriculars.html">here</a>

						<p> 
							In 2018, I went for Umrah (a pilgrimage) with my family to the cities of Makkah and Medinah in Saudi Arabia. 
							It was my first time visiting after 10 years. I really enjoyed the experience, and met so many 
							people of different cultures from around the world. The mosques were beautiful; I miss it so much. To the left is 
							a picture of the interior of Masjid Al Nabawi, one of the largest mosques in the world and the second holiest site 
							in Islam.
