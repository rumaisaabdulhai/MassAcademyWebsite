							<p> Hi there! My name is Rumaisa Abdulhai and I am currently a junior 
								at Mass Academy. My sending school was Shrewsbury High. I am the youngest of three siblings.
								My eldest sister attends medical school, and my other sister is a senior in college.
								In my free time, I love to draw and spend time with my family. I've lived in 3 different countries,
								and have attended 6 different schools before Mass Academy. The picture on the left is me (center) with my two sisters.</p>

						<div class="left_text">
							<p> I have twelve beautiful lovebirds. We started with only two from a nice bird owner, 
								and since then they've grown to a little flock! My birds love to eat apple
								and millet. They also love to chirp all day long, especially when they're sleepy. 
								We do let our birds fly around the house so they can have fun. The picture on the 
								right is my sister holding one of the birds when he was a baby.
								Fun fact: When lovebirds are small they have a black tint on their beaks 
								which disappears as they grow. Don't you think it's adorable?

						<div class="right_text">
							<p>This past summer I attended a 4-week long summer program called Beaver Works at MIT. I worked on the autonomous drone racing course.
								We had to program a research drone to autonomously navigate an illuminated trajectory while avoiding AR tagged obstacles.
								There were people from all over the United States. The picture on the left is me holding the drone with my team. 
								I can't believe we won 1st place at the end of our program!

							<p>My family is originally from a town in South India called Kengeri. The picture to the right is me with my 
								parents when we visited India last year for my cousin's wedding. Wedding festivities in India usually last
								a week or two, which I love because of all the great food I get to eat.
