					<p> 
						Hello! My name is Rumaisa Abdulhai, a senior at the Massachusetts Academy of Math & Science (MAMS) in Worcester, Massachusetts. 
						I am passionate about robotics and computer science. I have lived in 4 different countries, and attended 6 different schools in Doha, 
						Dubai, Seattle, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. The picture on the left is me with my two sisters at my sister's wedding last summer.

				<h3>Beaver Works Summer Program</h3>

				<div class="wrap">
					<img class= "right_image" src= "Images/beaverworks.JPG"  alt= "Me with My Team For the BWSI Summer Program">
						<p>
							In the summer of 2019, I attended a 4-week intensive program called Beaver Works at MIT, where I learned how to 
							program an intel drone using Python and the Robot Operating System (ROS) to autonomously navigate an obstacle course. 
							The picture to the right is my team, and I am holding the drone we competed with. We were excited to win 1st place at 
							the aerial vehicle racing competition. You can read more about my experience 
							<a class= "link" onClick="window.location.href='Extracurriculars.html#bwsi';">here</a>.

				<h3>International Math Modeling</h3>

				<div class="wrap">
					<img class= "left_image" src= "Images/IMMC_Gang.jpeg"  alt= "A Zoom Picture of Me with My Team">
						<p> 
							In April 2020, I competed in the 5-day International Math Modeling Contest (IMMC).
							We developed simulations of department store layouts in Python and Java to maximize revenue and minimize damage to 
							products during Black Friday sales. We incorporated factors such as popularity, rating, and cashier visibility
							in our complex mathematical model. We were pleasantly surprised to win the Finalist Prize! Read more about 
							my experience <a class= "link" onClick="window.location.href='Extracurriculars.html#modeling';">here</a>.

				<h3>My Birds</h3>

				<div class="wrap">
					<img class= "right_image" src= "Images/babybird.jpg"  alt= "My Sister Holding Our Baby Bird">
						<p> 
							I take care of twelve beautiful lovebirds. We started with only two from a nice bird owner, 
							and since then they've grown to a little flock! My birds love to eat apple
							and millet. They also love to chirp all day long, especially when they're sleepy. 
							The picture on the right is my sister holding one of the birds when he was a baby.

				<h3>Umrah Trip</h3>

				<div class="wrap">
					<img class= "left_image" src= "Images/umrah.png"  alt= "Me with Sisters in front of the Kaaba">
						<p>
							In December 2018, I went for Umrah (a pilgrimage) with my family to the cities of Makkah and Medinah in Saudi Arabia. 
							It was my first time visiting after 10 years. I really enjoyed the experience, and met so many people of 
							different cultures from around the world. The mosques were beautiful and I miss it so much. To the left is 
							me with my sisters in front of the Kaaba, the holiest site in Islam.
